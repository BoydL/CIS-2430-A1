The problem this program is trying to solve is allowing the user to schedules dates and look up the dates that
they have entered.

1.)In this program, the user is allowed to enter an event and select which type of event they are entering.
the user then enters the date at which it starts and ends. the user can enter many of these events, and 
can search for them later by using the search function.

2.)In my program, I assume at some level, the user knows that there is 30 days in a month and 24 hours in a day, and
60 minutes in and hour and so forth. My program has the limitation of not being able to show examples such as
"programming", and "java programming" as search results. My program does not check if the array is at it's limits
in terms of objects it can hold.

3.)A user can build and test my program by adding all the .java files to there netbeans IDE and running it.

4.) I Tested my program by adding a few objects to each of the three object arrays.
I printed these objects and related methods, to make sure all of the activity class and time class methods were working correctly.
I then tried every possible combinations of inputs to make sure that the search function was working to the best of my abilities

5.) I would user proof and make the styling and length of my code better, as well as make the search function
on my code more intuitive.
